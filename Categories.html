				<p id = "paragraph1" style = "margin-top: 14px">Action films are a film genre where action sequences, such as fighting, stunts, car chases or explosions, take precedence over elements like characterization or complex plotting. The action typically involves individual efforts on the part of the hero, in contrast with most war films. The genre is closely linked with the thriller and adventure film genres.</p>

				<h2><br></h2>
				<p id = "paragraph2">In the West, during the 1920s and 1930s, adventure films were popularised by actors such as <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a></b> and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Flynn">Errol Flynn</a></b>, but the settings were often period ones. The phenomenal success of the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond">James Bond series</a></b> in the 1960s and 1970s, helped to popularise the concept of the modern day action film in more recent years. The early Bond films were characterised by quick cutting, car chases, fist fights and ever more elaborate action sequences. The series also established the concept of the resourceful hero, who is able to dispatch the villains with a ready one-liner.<br>
					Action films tend to be expensive, requiring big budget special effects and stunt work. As such, they are regarded as mostly a Hollywood genre, although there have been a significant number of action films from Hong Kong which are primarily modern variations of the martial arts film. Because of these roots, Hong Kong action films typically center on acrobatics by the protagonist while American action films typically feature big explosions and modern technology.<br>



				<h2><br>Action Sub-Genres</h2><br>
				<p id = "paragraph3"><b></b> <b>Action drama -</b> Combines action set-pieces with serious themes, character insight and/or emotional power.<br>
<br><b>Action comedy -</b> Mixture of action and comedy usually based on mismatched partners (the standard "buddy film" formula) or unlikely setting.<br>

					<br><b>Action thriller -</b> Elements of action/adventure (car chases, shootouts, explosions) and thriller (plot twists, suspense, hero in jeopardy). Many of the James Bond series of films are icons of this popular sub-genre.<br>

					<br><b>Action horror -</b> As with science fiction action films, any sub-genre of action film can be combined with the elements of horror films to produce what has increasingly become a popular action sub-genre in its own right. Monsters, robots and many other staples of horror have been used in action films<br>

						<img src="Images\horror.jpg" alt="Horror category" style="height: 550px ;width: 910px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; box-shadow: 4px 4px 5px #707272; border-radius: 6px;" id = "images"><br>
					<p id = "paragraph1" style = "margin-top: 14px">A horror film is a film dominated by elements of horror. This film genre incorporates a number of sub-genres and repeated themes, such as slasher themes, vampire themes, zombie themes, demonic possession, alien mind control, evil children, cannibalism, werewolves, animals attacking humans, haunted houses, etc. The horror film genre is often associated with low budgets and exploitation, but major studios and well-respected directors have made intermittent forays into the genre. Some horror films exhibit a substantial amount of cross-over with other genres, particularly science fiction.<br>

					<h2><br></h2>
					<p id = "paragraph2">In the nuclear-charged atmosphere of the 1950s the tone of horror films shifted away from the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic">gothic</a></b> and towards the modern. A seemingly endless parade of low-budget productions featured humanity overcoming threats from Outside: alien invasions, and deadly mutations to people, plants, and insects. During this time the horror and sci-fi genres were often interchangable. These films provided ample opportunity for audience exploitation, with gimmicks such as 3-D and <b><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/perception">"Percepto"</a></b> drawing audiences in week after week for bigger and better scares.<br>
          <h2><br>Horror Sub-Genres</h2><br>
					<p id = "paragraph3"><b></b> <b>Paranormal -</b> Paranormal horror is closely related to the demonic subgenre in that it focuses on characters who aren’t living beings. Spirits and ghosts spook viewers and create fear without a physical presence on screen. For example, furniture moves without anyone touching it or a chill passes through the air out of nowhere. Those are elements of paranormal activity that can be from a demon spirit, supernatural power or ghost. <br>
	          <br><b>Demon Possession -</b> Sometimes thought of as supernatural horror, this subgenre plays into the unknown of the human experience. Demons have been part of historical storytelling for centuries. They represent evil in many forms including mythical, religious and supernatural. <br>

						<br><b>Zombie -</b>Zombie movies cross multiple horror subgenres. One part monster movie, one part possession, zombie thrillers make a perfect cocktail of terror. Somehow they are the most difficult villain to kill off and just keep coming back for more. These corpse-like characters are cannibalistic by nature and can infect their victims with a single bite. <br>

						<br><b>Comedic horror -</b> Comedic horror is possibly the most fun of all horror movies out there. It’s a subgrene that is equally funny as it is scary. It takes the viewer to complete opposite ends of the horror spectrum resulting in a rollercoaster of emotions.<br>
